Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can be divided into cognitive empathy, which is understanding someone's perspective, and emotional or feeling empathy, which is feeling what someone else feels. Empathy can be improved through active listening, perspective-taking, and self-awareness.

Nonverbal communication and empathy are essential in building strong relationships and effective communication. By understanding and improving these aspects, we can better connect with others and create a more fulfilling life.
