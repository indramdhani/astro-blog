1. The Pareto principle states that 80% of outcomes are generated from only 20% of the effort. Optimizing this 20% and reducing the rest can lead to huge gains in results.
2. 80/20 managers apply the Pareto principle to every aspect of their work. They focus on tasks, issues, and meetings that will deliver the biggest impact.
3. They give 80% time and attention to 20% most important work. By applying the Eisenhower productivity matrix, they spend more time attending to work that’s important, reduce or delegate tasks that are urgent and eliminate work that shouldn’t be done at all.
4. They spend 80% time listening to their team’s concerns, ideas and opinions. By speaking less and listening more, they’re able to increase their team’s productivity and performance.
5. They spend 80% of their time coaching their 20% of top performers. Keeping their top performers effective and motivated leads to the biggest gains in results.
6. They spend 80% asking questions and 20% providing answers. By helping their team identify their own solutions, they empower them to think independently and make their own decisions.
7. They spend 80% time praising people and 20% being critical. By recognizing employees for their contributions and helping them get better, they enable their team to achieve more than they ever thought possible.
