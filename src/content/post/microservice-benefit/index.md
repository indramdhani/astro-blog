Below are some benefits of using microservices to achieve greater results. However this might not applied to all company or team as they have their own case.

- **Decoupling:** Microservices refer to the practice of breaking down large, complex software applications into smaller, independent services that have their own specific functionalities and databases. This approach enables developers to work on individual services without affecting the entire application, thereby improving productivity and facilitating the adoption of a more agile development methodology.
- **Improved Scalability:** By using microservices, the company can scale its services more effectively. If a particular service experiences high demand, it can be scaled independently without affecting other services, thereby ensuring that the overall platform performance is not compromised.
- **Data Management:** Microservices also allow the company to manage its data more efficiently. With data being stored in multiple, smaller databases, they can employ different strategies for data backup, recovery, and archiving based on the specific service requirements.
- **Technology Stack Flexibility:** Microservices architecture enables the team to use different technology stacks for each service, depending on the specific needs and requirements of that service. This flexibility allows the company to adopt emerging technologies more easily and ensures that developers can use the most suitable tools for building and maintaining each service.
- **Fault Tolerance:** With microservices, if one service fails, it does not necessarily mean that the entire application will crash. This is because the other services are independent and can continue to operate without interruption. This fault tolerance is a significant advantage for a company, whose services are used by millions of subscribers worldwide.
